##### Project for learning purpose for computer vision and AI/ML

> What is computer vision?  **Computer vision is a field of AI that trains computers to capture and interpret information from image and video data** . By applying machine learning (ML) models to images, computers can classify objects and respond—like unlocking your smartphone when it recognizes your face.

In this repository we dive in more fields in computer vision and some AI/ML libraries to apply many algorithms in our data.

##### Content of this repository

> * Video processing with OpenCV ,Face Detection,Object and movement detection.
> * Shape detection and counting object on real time via default camera.
> * Drawing different type of contours (Circle,rectangle,Triangle.. ) in image or video (real time).
> * Applying algorithms provided by OpenCv for image processing (Segmentation,Morphological algorithms...).
> * Applying algorithms provided by Sklearn to preform many actions (Emotion Detection,)
> * Inspect mouse events to manipulate image (Live Drawing,)

##### Project for learning purpose for computer vision and AI/ML

> What is computer vision?  **Computer vision is a field of AI that trains computers to capture and interpret information from image and video data** . By applying machine learning (ML) models to images, computers can classify objects and respond—like unlocking your smartphone when it recognizes your face.

In this repository we dive in more fields in computer vision and some AI/ML libraries to apply many algorithms in our data.

##### Content of this repository

    Uses of Erosion and Dilation: 
        Erosion: 
            It is useful for removing small white noises.
            Used to detach two connected objects etc.
        Dilation:
            In cases like noise removal, erosion is followed by dilation. 
            Because, erosion removes white noises, but it also shrinks our object. 
            So we dilate it. Since noise is gone, they wonâ€™t come back, but our object area increases.
            It is also useful in joining broken parts of an object.
